Requirements
===========

It is highly recommended to use the Eclipse framework to develop on the xsmp modeler.

The **_Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers_** package can be downloaded from `here <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/>`__.

Import XSMP projects into your workspace
=======================================

1. Go to **File** → **Imports...** → **Projects from Git (with smart import)** → **Clone URI** and specify the URI of this repository.
2. All XSMP projects should be imported into your workspace.

Configure the Target platform
=============================

The XSMP modeler comes with a target platform that defines all the required plugins for development.

1. Select the **org.eclipse.xsmp.target** in the **Window** → **Preferences** → **Plug-in Development** → **Target Platform** page (the plugins resolution should take a while).

Configure the Java Formatter
============================

All the XSMP code should be formatted with the provided Profile.

1. Import the **formatter-java-eclipse.xml** file in **Window** → **Preferences** → **Java** → **Code Style** → **Formatter** and select the **XSMP** profile.

Build the project
=================

Many files are generated by the build process. Follow these steps:

1. Select the file **pom.xml** at the root of the repository.
2. **Right-click** → **Run As** → **Maven install**.
